# terraria-hd-textures
Converts Terraria textures to HD resolution. Original by sullerandras, rescripted by me.

# Usage:
1. Copy all the .xnb files from `"<terraria folder>\Content\Images"` to `"ASSETS\Content\Images"` or SOURCE_XNB_FOLDER in main.py
2. Run the script with `python main.py`
3. Get the zipped texture pack :)

 # Possible Issues
 Errorring on script `remove_separators.py` can break the next steps so if it doesnt work copy everything from 'downscaled' to 'no_seps' folders.
 Also, if you are converting a texture pack but not .xnb files, you should copy all the textures to `"extracted"` folder and comment out a line `extractPngsFromTerraria(SOURCE_XNB_FOLDER, EXTRACTED_FOLDER)` in main.py
