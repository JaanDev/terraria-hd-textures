# terraria-hd-textures
Converts Terraria textures to HD resolution. Original by sullerandras, rescripted by me.

# Usage:
1. Copy all the .xnb files from `"<terraria folder>\Content\Images"` to `"source\Content\Images"` or SOURCE_XNB_FOLDER in main.py
2. Run the script with `python main.py`
3. Get the zipped texture pack :)
